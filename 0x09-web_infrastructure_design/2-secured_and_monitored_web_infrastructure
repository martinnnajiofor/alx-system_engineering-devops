What are firewalls for ?

The firewalls protect the network against any unauthorized users that try to acess it. It shelds the network from unnecessary network traffic. 



Why is the traffic served over HTTPS ?

The traffic is served over HTTPS because it is more secure. HTTPS uses port 443, which encrypts outgoing information. That in turn makes it very difficult for a hacker to spy on your site's data. 


What are the monitoring clients used for ?

The monitors are used to monitor the servers and the external network. As they monitor the servers, they gather information such as the CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O, Network, Disk Usage, processes, etc. It can also alert the admins to any issue that arises as the server runs. 


Issues with this infrastructure ?

If the SSL certificate was to be terminated, then there won't be any encryption on the network. a SPOF in this infrastucture is the single MySQL server, this is because it is not scalable. The problem with having the same components in all servers will be that If a single one of those components is compromised, the whole system is left vulnerable.
